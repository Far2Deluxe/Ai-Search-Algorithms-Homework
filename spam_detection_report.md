# Email Spam Detection Project Report

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning system for email spam detection using various algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

## Dataset
- Source: mail_data.csv
- Size: 5572 emails
- Classes: Spam (747), Ham (4825)
- Train-Test Split: 80%-20%

## Models Evaluated
                     Accuracy  Precision  Recall  F1 Score
Logistic Regression    0.9740     1.0000  0.8054    0.8922
Random Forest          0.9830     1.0000  0.8725    0.9319
SVM                    0.9910     0.9929  0.9396    0.9655
Naive Bayes            0.9812     1.0000  0.8591    0.9242

## Best Model
- Algorithm: SVM
- Accuracy: 0.9910
- F1 Score: 0.9655
- Parameters: {'kernel': 'linear'}

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning and label encoding
2. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization with 5000 features
3. **Model Training**: Multiple algorithms compared
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search with cross-validation
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 scores

## Feature Engineering
- TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams
- Text length analysis
- Spam keyword detection
- URL detection
- Exclamation mark and capital letter counting

## Key Findings
1. SVM with linear kernel achieved the best performance (99.1% accuracy, 96.6% F1)
2. TF-IDF features alone were sufficient for excellent performance
3. Feature engineering with additional text features did not improve SVM performance
4. The model shows strong generalization with minimal overfitting

## Error Analysis
- Total misclassified: 22 emails
- Misclassification rate: 1.97%
- False positives: 1 (HAM → SPAM)
- False negatives: 21 (SPAM → HAM)

## Future Improvements
1. Experiment with deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers) for better context understanding
2. Implement ensemble methods combining multiple models
3. Add more sophisticated feature engineering (sentiment analysis, writing style)
4. Collect more diverse and recent spam examples to improve detection of evolving spam techniques

## API Implementation
- RESTful API built with Flask
- Real-time spam prediction endpoint
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Health monitoring endpoint

## Usage
The trained model can be used via:
1. Direct Python inference
2. Flask REST API (/predict endpoint)
3. Saved model file for deployment

## Files Created
- spam_detector_model.pkl (trained model)
- tfidf_vectorizer.pkl (feature vectorizer)
- spam_detection_report.md (this documentation)
