jupyter Homework V3 file contains all the exercises, however, Exercise 4.1 (which uses flask lib to create an API) requires to be run in a regular py file since flask tends to try to re-run the code which fails on jupyter notebook, therefore exercise 4.1 is saved in
External python file called "Exercise 4 Api.py" and the test code that connects the API is contained with in the jupiter file "jupyter Homework V3.ipynb".
